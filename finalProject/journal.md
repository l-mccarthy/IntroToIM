# Final Project Journal

## Preliminary Concept 19/04

### Description

I will be creating an 8 step sequencer. A step sequencer is a hardware unit that divides a measure of music into a pre-determined number of note values called "steps". Considering the nature of step sequencers and limitations of both my knowledge and technology available to me, this device will either be a drum machine or bassline sequencer in the vein of the legendary Roland TB-303 Bassline synthesizer. Although, I am wondering if I can do "both" by using states in p5 somehow. Additionally, I believe the majority of step sequencers have 16 steps but incorporating 16 might be too much, but I might give it a shot!

### UPDATE 22/04: Daniel's description

For my final project I am thinking to develop a 8-step sequencer with some controls such as BPM (speed of playback), notes on/off, note pitch and change octaves. This part would be mainly the Arduino doing the action. In regards of p5js, I believe I will do some kind of animation or objects moving in relationship to the sounds produce by the sequencer. The idea as of now is still a little raw, but I have found some videos in YouTube that can serve as inspiration to develop this project.

### Arduino

Arduino circuit and program will allow users to control the steps using buttons that are in a row. A potentiometer can control note pitch. Another potentiometer can control which drum sound/sample is used (kick, clap, hi-hat, etc.). Plus, a row of LEDs for every step will light up showing each step used. If I can find a way, I could also add potentiometers to control lowpass and highpass filters.

### p5.js

p5.js will be my "synthesizer" as the signals being sent from Arduino will correspond to a certain sound in the code. I might additionally have a saw wave emulator for the bassline (which is one of the built-in p5.js examples). Moreover, I could also display a sound viusalizer on screen using p5.

## Group Partner 21/04

Turns out Daniel is doing the exact same project as me! We have decided to partner up.
