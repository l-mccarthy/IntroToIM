## Description of our project

Daniel and Liam, for the final concept, created an 8 step sequencer, and a step sequencer is a hardware unit that divides a measure of music into a pre-determined number of note values called "steps". So, we asked ourselves the question of how do we elevate / make this different to existing step sequencers? And the answer was to take advantage of using both Arduino and p5.js, analog and digital. Not only is the user be physically interacting with the hardware, but they are also interacting with the display of p5 to see what notes they are sequencing in sort of a "piano roll" feature. In most modern DAW (digital audio workstation) software, the term "piano roll" refers to a graphical display of, and means of editing, MIDI note data; along with entering the pitch, length and velocity of notes manually, instead of recording the output of a device for entering note data, like a keyboard.
