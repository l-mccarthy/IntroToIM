# Midterm Project: _It Was Chasing the Chicken_

Playing on a variation of the "chicken crossing the road" joke, my game answers the question "why did the _fox_ cross the road?" with "because it was chasing the chicken." As a result, the user plays as a fox that is chasing after an elusive chicken through a busy, chaotic - and seemingly endless - highway. My game would be classified as an endless runner game, which is a subgenre of platform game in which the player character is forced to run for an infinite amount of time while avoiding obstacles, which are cars in this case. While the endless nature of the game may seem daunting to the player, I made sure to make the game slightly more difficult as the player progressed.

Moreover, when finalizing the game's design, I had to make the decision if the objective of the game was for the player to "catch" the chicken or to get as high a score as possible. I can't have both objectives in the game as it would get too convoluted. For the former, chasing and catching the chicken will remove the increasing difficulty aspect since it would be easier to reach the chicken when obstacles are moving slower, which means obstacles would have to move at a uniform speed. For the latter, the chicken aspect of the game merely becomes an aesthetic and thematic choice with no effect on gameplay. I decided to go with the highscore objective as it urges the player to want to play again. Since catching the chicken gives the player a sense of completion, they will likley have no inclination to play again - the game ceases to be endless. When researching which games are the most popular, the majority of them have proven to be very addictive due to their endless nature. The competitive aspect of the game becomes a competition with the player themself, rather than in beating the game.

## Game Mechanics
* Begins with a menu screen that displays a whimsical [vector image](https://pixabay.com/vectors/fox-animal-mammal-wild-animal-5679446/), simple instructions for the player to follow, and the sound of a highway with brief sporadic chicken clucks which plays as long as the program is running (the image I used is under the creative commons license).
