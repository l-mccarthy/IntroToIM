### Initial concept for the project

Everyone has heard the age old "why the chicken crossed the road" joke many times, as well as its countless variations. In fact, a game developer called Hipster Whale made a mobile game back in 2014 called "Crossy Road" that plays with this joke, making a chicken cross an endless amount of roads without being flattened by a speeding vehicle. The game was a smash hit and dominated app stores.

However, the main concept of the game has been done before, back in 1981 with an arcade game called "Frogger". The object of the game is for the player to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards. Very similar! Except, Crossy Road is endless whereas Frogger is contained to a single screen layout.

As a result, I plan to take this concept and create my own spin on it in p5.js. I wanted to continue with the chicken-crossing-the-road motif established by "Crossy Road" and I remembered a certain variation of the joke:

_Why did the fox cross the road?_
_She was chasing the chicken._

Why not have the player play as the fox? The fox will chase the chicken across this treacherous road and the game ends when the fox catches the chicken. Thus, giving the game a greater objective than simply getting as high a score as possible. However, I am yet to decide if this is the direction I want to go - if the running chicken is part of the game or simply a "carrot and stick" mechanism. Regardless, I will be implementing the high score element whether or not I will need it in the final project, we'll see. In addition, I will obviously have obstacles in the game, likely cars, but I am not sure if I will also have the logs obstacle (the player will cross a body of water on moving logs) as seen in "Frogger" since it seems too complex for me to wrap my head around and code.

### Risky/Complex/Unknown part(s) of my project
