# OOP Generative Artwork: Bubbles That Pop!

# Reflection

The  overall concept of my artwork is to simply showcase the behaviour of bubbles, to watch them as they slowly fall and flutter, and to perhaps interact with them. To try and get some ideas, I was brainstorming common objects that appear in nature which I can program a class out of. My goal was to elevate Dan Shiffmanâ€™s tutorials on Object Oriented Programming (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) into an artwork with aesthetic appeal. In his tutorial, Shiffman demonstrated how to make a simple class, whereby used a bubble as inspiration. As a result, I used his class as a basis for my artwork bu changed a few aspects which I found unfit, such as making all the bubbles moves uniformly downards and having different random sizes for each bubble. This was the "generative" part, I have the object but I need to incorporate randomness to achieve this goal. Hence, along with random sizes, the bubbles shifted side to side on random intervals and appeared in random location within the boundaries of the canvas
