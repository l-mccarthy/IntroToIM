## Reflection

As a film student, it comes without saying that I love movies. Therefore, I wanted to create some sort of data visualization pertaining this topic. Some of my ideas included showing how many movies are being made each year for different countries, or ?. In the end, I decided on a more personal concept as I realised I had this data readily available to me. I use an IMDB account (Internet Movie Database) to keep track of my watchlist as well as movies I have already seen, and once I have seen a movie I would enter a star rating out of 10. Conveniently, the website has a feature where I can export my ratings relative to the movie to a .csv file, as shown below.
