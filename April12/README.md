# Musical Instrument - A Theremin (of sorts?)

Named after its inventor, Leon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928, the theremin is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the person playing it. In fact, the theremin is considered to be the first electronic musical instrument ever made. While an actual theremin works by generating electromagnetic fields around two antennae, the closest component to mirror this lack of physical contact is the ultrasonic sensor - which formed the basis of our musical instrument.

Essentially, we designed this instrument to play a specific note depending on how far away your hand (or an object) is from the sensor. Below is a video of the final product in use, note what happens to the pitches when the ruler moves closer and away from the sensor, as well as when the button is pressed:
