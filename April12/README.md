# Musical Instrument - A Theremin (of sorts?)

Named after its inventor, Leon Theremin, who patented the device in 1928, the theremin is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the person playing it. While an actual theremin works by generating electromagnetic fields around two antennae, the closest component to mirror this lack of physical contact is the ultrasonic sensor - which formed the basis of our musical instrument.
