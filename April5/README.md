### Description:

![button](https://github.com/l-mccarthy/IntroToIM/blob/main/April5/Media/button_pushed.JPG)

* The digital sensor is the push-button and the analog sensor is the light-dependent resistor (LDR).
* The circuit emulates a race track light when the button is pressed as the lights count down each second to the green light, as seen in the image and demo video above.
* When not pressed, the red lights blink in a downward pattern to signify waiting, as if skipping the final green light.
* The darker the environment, the faster the red lights alternate when the button is not pressed.

### Problems and Discoveries:

* I think I have become more comfortable with using Arduino in that I did not run into any problems (compared to previous attempts where I blew out an LED) and that I was able to experiment and, most importantly, have fun with the code once I made the circuit.
* In addition, circuit building for me is adding one element at a time and testing if it works before moving on to the next. Because these components are in parallel, troubleshooting and problemsolving becomes easier.
* I also found creating my schematic using Microsoft PowerPoint's shape tools on a blank slide to be both super organized and time-consuming, so I am not sure if I will go this route again when drawing my schematic. 
* Organization is very important! Colour coding and arranging the wires in tandem with the circuit's various components on the breadboard were crucial when it came to transferring my schematic into a tangible, working product.
